✅ When using:
uid = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4())
uuid.uuid4() is called immediately when the class is defined, not when the model instance is created.

The resulting UUID object is fixed and stored as the default.

Every new object will receive the same UUID, which breaks uniqueness.

✅ When using:

uid = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4)
uuid.uuid4 is passed as a callable function (a reference, not executed yet).

Django will call uuid.uuid4() function each time when a new object is created, generating a unique UUID.

This ensures each model instance has its own unique UID, as intended.
